Shared Dependencies:

1. **Porcupine**: This is the wake word detection library used in "porcupine.py". It will be a shared dependency as it might be needed in the run scripts to initialize the wake word detection.

2. **Whisper ASR API**: This is the Automatic Speech Recognition system used in "whisper_asr.py". It will be a shared dependency as it might be needed in the run scripts to initialize the speech recognition.

3. **GPT API**: This is the Natural Language Processing API used in "gpt_api.py". It will be a shared dependency as it might be needed in the run scripts to initialize the natural language processing.

4. **TTS System**: This is the Text-to-Speech system used in "tts_system.py". It will be a shared dependency as it might be needed in the run scripts to initialize the text-to-speech synthesis.

5. **Home Automation APIs**: These are the APIs used in "home_automation_api.py" to control home devices. They will be shared dependencies as they might be needed in the run scripts to initialize the home automation.

6. **Learning Module**: This is the module used in "learning_module.py" for continuous learning and improvement. It will be a shared dependency as it might be needed in the run scripts to initialize the learning module.

Shared Variables:

1. **Wake Word**: This is the word that activates K.A.R.A. It will be shared across the wake word detection, speech recognition, and run scripts.

2. **User Commands**: These are the commands given by the user. They will be shared across the speech recognition, natural language processing, text-to-speech synthesis, home automation, and learning module.

3. **Responses**: These are the responses generated by K.A.R.A. They will be shared across the natural language processing, text-to-speech synthesis, and learning module.

Function Names:

1. **Initialize**: This function will be used in the run scripts to initialize the different modules.

2. **Listen**: This function will be used in the wake word detection and speech recognition to listen for the wake word and user commands.

3. **Process**: This function will be used in the natural language processing to process the user commands.

4. **Execute**: This function will be used in the home automation to execute the tasks.

5. **Learn**: This function will be used in the learning module to learn from the interactions.

6. **Speak**: This function will be used in the text-to-speech synthesis to convert the responses into speech.
