Shared Dependencies:

1. **Wake Word**: The wake word "Hey Kara" is a shared dependency as it is used to activate the assistant and is referenced in multiple files such as "wake_word_detection.py" and "main.py".

2. **ASR API**: The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, specifically the Whisper ASR API from OpenAI, is used in both "speech_recognition.py" and "main.py" to convert spoken commands into text.

3. **GPT API**: The GPT API from OpenAI is used in "natural_language_processing.py" and "main.py" to process text and generate responses.

4. **TTS System**: The Text-to-Speech (TTS) system is used in "text_to_speech_synthesis.py" and "main.py" to convert text responses back into speech.

5. **Home Automation APIs**: These APIs are used in "home_automation_integration.py" and "main.py" to control various home automation devices.

6. **User Interaction Data**: This data is used in "continuous_learning.py" and potentially other files to help K.A.R.A. learn and improve from each interaction. This could include data schemas for storing and analyzing past interactions.

7. **Function Names**: Functions such as `detect_wake_word()`, `convert_speech_to_text()`, `process_text()`, `synthesize_speech()`, `control_home_devices()`, and `learn_from_interaction()` would be defined in their respective files and called in "main.py".

8. **Message Names**: Messages like `wake_word_detected`, `command_received`, `response_generated`, `command_executed`, and `learning_completed` could be used across multiple files to communicate the status of various operations.

9. **User Information**: Any key information about the user that K.A.R.A. needs to remember would be shared across multiple files. This could include the user's name, preferences, past interactions, etc.
